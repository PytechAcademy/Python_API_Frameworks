# Python API Frameworks

This project explores two popular Python web frameworks for building APIs: FastAPI and Flask. It includes sample code and documentation for each framework, allowing you to compare and contrast their features and capabilities.

## Project Structure
- `config.py`: Configuration file for storing sensitive information (e.g., database URIs, API keys).
- `fast-api.py`: Sample code and documentation for a FastAPI-based API.
- `flask-api.py`: Sample code and documentation for a Flask-based API.
